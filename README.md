# SV-Projekt
The github repository for our team's project for the Collective Behaviour class 2022/23

Our project is based on a paper by Ivanov & Palamas. 2022. Collective Adaptation in Multi-Agent Systems: How Predator Confusion Shapes Swarm-Like Behaviors, https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06338  
We intend to reimplement the simulation described in the above paper.   
By the first report, we intend to study the paper and underlying concepts and possibly start planning our implementation.  
By the second report, we intend to have a working prototype of the solution and plan potential expansions of the work.  
By the third (final) report, we intend to polish our implementation and compare it to the original paper.
